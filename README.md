This is a command line messenging app (mostly an excuse to work with an async server).

Known issues:
-client side buffer needs fixing (arrow keys and delete are causing problems)
-client side isn't printing incoming messages when buffer gets wonky

TODOs:
-add print statement to client side that shows what that client has said
